Random assortment of stuff I have made in Unity which I don't version control elsewhere. Most of these are likely to be one-off experiments or attempts at making something which didn't fully work out for one reason or another.

Each thing will have a license associated with it in its source or folder.

**NAK.Contacts**

Clean-room replication of VRCs contacts system with added functionality which I had made canny posts for back when it initially released.

**VisualClone**

Performant head-hiding solution which scales even on fucked-up monstrosities of an avatar with hundreds of renderers on it.

Originally hosted on gist which was impossible to discover:

>  Unity VR avatar head hiding script. Meant to be as performant as possible without scaling bones (jank), swapping bones (alloc), forceRecalculationPerRender (does not scale), or a dedicated shadow clone. Please see comments for ramblings.
